 # JupyterLab Presentation!
 
 ## JupyterLab is:
 
 * web based IDE for programming
 
 * built for data science and analysis
 
 * has more features than Jupyter Notebooks
 
 * notebooks can be shared
 
 * GitHub can show notebooks
 
 ## Install and run JupyterLab
 
 * start Python virutal environment
 
 `python -m venv python_jupyter`
 
 `source python_jupyter/bin/activate`
 * install necessary packages
 
 `pip install jupyerlab pandas matplotlib`
 * run JupyterLab
 
 `jupyter lab`
 
 ## Features
 
 * CSV Files can be viewed within the web interface, can also view .json files (not used here today)
 
 * Markdown syntax allows for better text presentation - sane syntax as GitHub Wikis
 
 * Terminal can run plain Python and Linux commands
 
 * many extensions are available
 
 * can create/edit text files, python files
 
 ## Notebook
 
 * has cells that can contain code, markdown, or raw data
 
 * cells can run one at a time or in sequence
 
 * output can be displayed or hidden
 
 * order of cells can be changed
 
 * notebook files (*.ipynb) can be shared
 
 * output can contain text, graphs, whatever
 
 ## Pandas
 
 * data exploring, analysis, manipulation, "data cleaning"
 * data series - spreadsheet column
 * data frame - multi dimensional data
 * can select data (select column to deal with)
 * data can be cleaned up - remove or fix data errors
 * works with matplotlib to plot data
 * this is a big topic - in no way has this scratched the surface
 
 ## Matplotlib
 
 * works with numpy
 * makes graphs easy
 * graph sizes, labels, colors
 * line, pie, scatter
 
 
 ## A few words about GitHub
 * GitHub push 
 * sharing notebooks
 * display notebooks in GitHub
